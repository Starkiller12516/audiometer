    "An audiometer is a device which evaluates the hearing ability. The hearing ability is characterized by the intensity and frequency range of sound that the human ear is capable to detect. Therefore, the audiometer plays pure tones of different frequency and intensity through a earspeaker, bone conduction hearing aid or a loudspeaker. The sequence of measurement is defined by the standard ISO EN 8253 1-3. The technical standard is described in ISO EN 60645 1-3. Furthermore, audiometers have to meet the requirements of calibration according to the series of standards ISO 389. "
